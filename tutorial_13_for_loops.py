# Introduction to Loops:
    
# Sometimes a programmer wants to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops. Based on this loops are further classified into following main types;

# * for loop
# * while loop


# The for Loop: 
    
# for loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python. Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over strings, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.


# print(1)
# print(2)
# print(3)
# print(4)
# print(5)
# print(6)
# print(7)
# print(8)
# print(9)
# print(10)

# for string


# name = "Sunfire sensei"
# for i in name:
#  print(i)
#  if(i=="n"):
#      print("N")



#for list

# car= ["BMW","AUDI","SWIFT", "ALTO","RANGE ROVER"]
# for cars in car:
#     print(cars)
#     for i in cars:
#         print(i)
     
        
        
# Range()

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# for num in range (101,20001):
#     print(num)
    
    
# Print A to Z char.
